habitrpg-ncurses
================

node + ncurses interface for habitRPG.

This is set up to meet my general task workflow and my preferences.  Todo lists are simple enought that I feel like investing time into making something that works exactly how I want it to work is worthwhile.  Plus I felt like learning ncurses. At this point, attempt to use at your own risk.

To use, copy the config.json.sample to config.json, and update with your information.

There are apparently issues with the ncurses node library I'm using on OSX, so it might not behave as expected. 

Example of what it looks like in the context of my workspace:
