habitrpg-ncurses
================

node + ncurses interface for habitRPG.

This is set up to meet my general task workflow and my preferences.  Todo lists are simple enought that I feel like investing time into making something that works exactly how I want it to work is worthwhile.  Plus I felt like learning ncurses. At this point, attempt to use at your own risk.

Apparently the ncurses binding doesn't seem to work properly when loaded from npm.  Grabbing the master branch from https://github.com/mscdex/node-ncurses works for me.

Example of what it looks like in the context of my workspace:
