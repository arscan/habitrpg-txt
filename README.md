Text interface for [HabitRPG](http://habitrpg.com).

This is set up to meet my general task workflow and my preferences.  Todo lists are simple enought that I feel 
like investing time into making something that works exactly how I want it to work is worthwhile.  At this point, 
attempt to use at your own risk.

To use, copy the config.json.sample to config.json, and update with your information.

Press ? for help with keyboard shortcuts.  Key bindings are similar to those of VIM (j for up, k for down, etc).

Example of what it looks like in the context of my workspace:
